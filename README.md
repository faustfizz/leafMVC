# Leaf
LeafMVC is a simple MVC framework built on top of the leaf php micro-framework. LeafMVC lets you create clean but powerful web apps and APIs quickly. Leaf provides simple to use functions to take care of complex issues, eventually speeding up development and taking the pain out of development.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Leaf.

```bash
$ composer create project leafs/mvc <project-name>
```

This will start a new LeafMVC app.

LeafMVC has a very easy to understand [documentation](https://leafmvc.netlify.com/) which contains information on all operations in LeafMVC.
